# Eye State Detection with OpenCV

A Python-based project for basic image analysis using OpenCV. It detects human faces and facial landmarks from image sequences, calculates the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**, and determines whether the eyes are open or closed over time. This can be used for simple drowsiness detection or blink detection scenarios.

The system uses:
- Haar cascade for face detection
- LBF model for landmark detection
- EAR thresholding for eye state classification
- Annotation comparison for accuracy evaluation
